### Description

The surface is a large area, so vehicles may be utilized by certain teams. Vehicles are lock-able. They also have hull-health and tire-health. Certain vehicles may also be equipped with weaponry.

#### Hull-health

Shooting the hull will lower its hull-health. If the health is below a certain point (depending on the vehicle), it will have smoke coming out of the engines. Going below the health and the engine will cause a fire, making it unusable. This is repairable if you have a mechanical kit. 

#### Tire-health

Each tire has its own health. If it is below a certain health (depending on which vehicle as well) will cause it to fuction less efficiently. The health being 0 will cause the tire to not function at all. This is repairable if you have a mechanical kit.

#### Despawning

A vehicle can either be manually despawned or if one of the events have occured:
- The vehicle's bodyhealth has been destroyed. (respawning after 4 minutes)
- The vehicle is unlocked and no one has entered the driver seat for the past 15 minutes.

#### Locking
A vehicle may be locked by the driver. Have the vehicle locked and no one can enter any seat. If the driver leaves while the vehicle is locked, the vehicle will be automatically unlocked.
