### Description

The surface is a large area, so vehicles may be utilized by certain teams. Vehicles are lock-able. They also have hull-health and tire-health. Certain vehicles may also be equipped with weaponry.

#### Hull-health

Shooting the hull will lower its hull-health. If the health is below a certain point (depending on the vehicle), it will have smoke coming out of the engines. Going below the health and the engine will cause a fire, making it unusable. This is repairable if you have a mechanical kit. 

#### Tire-health

Each tire has its own health. If it is below a certain health (depending on which vehicle as well) will cause it to fuction less efficiently. The health being 0 will cause the tire to not function at all. This is repairable if you have a mechanical kit.

#### Despawning

A vehicle can either be manually despawned or if one of the events have occured:
- The vehicle's bodyhealth has been destroyed. (respawning after 4 minutes)
- No one has entered the driver seat for the past 15 minutes.
