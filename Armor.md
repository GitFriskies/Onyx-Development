# Armor

### DESCRIPTION

All combatants receive a locker where they may equip certain armor and equipment. Only certain items are available depending on the team and rank. Armor is infinite and does not require supplying (E&TS) as its importance to gameplay is extreme.

### ARMOR
Armor can affect you in protection and mobility. Armor has a level. Heavy armor provides more protection but less mobility, and the same vice-versa.

#### Protection:
Armor does not upper your health; it lowers the damage received by weapons. __Armor only affects damage received by firearms.__

#### Mobility:
Armor affects your walk-speed. Higher level armor will provide less mobility.

### EQUIPMENT
Equipment may affect visually or gameplay-wise. __This equipment goes on your helmet, so it is required to wear armor.__

#### Gasmasks
Gas masks will provide protection from certain gasses and SCPs. __However, certain SCPs/gasses do not provide protection and requires a hazmat suit or Beta 7 equipment.__

#### Night Visions/Helmet Light
Night Visions and helmet lights are provided for more visiblity in dark areas. Wearing NVGs will also allow you to see IR-Beacons placed on certain combatants.
