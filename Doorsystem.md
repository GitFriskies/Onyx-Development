# Doorsystem

## Framework

### RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification)

The door uses an RFID system. You hold a tag against a scanner and your access will be processed.

- RFID Tag: used to open doors.
- RFID Replicator: used to steal RFID tag authentication by putting a stolen RFID tag onto the RFID replicator.
- RFID Scrambler: used to 'hack' a door open. Given to hostile personnel.

#### RFID Replicator

The RFID replicator can replicate RFID tags and open doors once replicating an RFID tag. The RFID tag must be stolen from a dead person in order to replicate it and hand it over to other hostile personnel.

#### RFID Scrambler

The RFID scrambler can open any door in 3 seconds. This tool is given to all hostile personnel.

### Access

Both the players team and foundation clearance are checked. If any of the requirements are met, the door opens.
